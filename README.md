## Setup

This repository contains a frontend and a backend folder. This means that each folder is a complete environment (`package.json`, `/node_modules`). They are completely independent. You cannot reference code from one environment in the other environment.

### The Frontend

1. Open a terminal in VS Code
2. Type `cd frontend`
3. Type `yarn install`

Use `yarn dev:frontend` to start the frontend dev environment.

### The Backend

1. Open _another_ terminal in VS Code
2. Type `cd backend`
3. Type `yarn install`

Use `yarn dev:backend` to start the backend dev environment.
